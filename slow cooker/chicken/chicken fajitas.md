## Ingredients ##
* 1 (15-ounce) can diced tomatoes
* 1 canned chipotle pepper in adobo sauce, finely chopped
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 5 ml (1 tsp) ground cumin
* 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) smoked paprika
* 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) teaspoon kosher salt
* 1.25 ml (1/4 tsp) teaspoon ground coriander

* 3 medium bell peppers, thinly sliced
* 1 large sweet onion, thinly sliced
* 30 ml (2 tbsp) freshly squeezed lime juice

## Instructions ##
1. Make the tomato mixture: Place the tomatoes, chipotle pepper, garlic, cumin, paprika, salt, and coriander in a medium bowl and stir to combine.
1. Layer the ingredients in the slow cooker: Spread about 1/2 of the tomato mixture onto the bottom of a 6-quart or larger slow cooker. Add the chicken breast in a single layer. Top with the peppers and onion, the finish with the remaining tomato mixture.
1. Slow cook: Cover and cook until the chicken is pull-apart tender, 6 to 7 hours on the LOW setting, 3 to 4 hours on the HIGH setting.
1. Shred the chicken and add the lime juice: Use 2 large forks to shred the chicken breasts right in the slow cooker. Add the lime juice and stir to combine.
1. Serve: Serve with warm tortillas, guacamole, and sour cream, or other desired toppings.
