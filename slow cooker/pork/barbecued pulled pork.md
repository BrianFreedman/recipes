# Barbecued Pulled Pork

Source: The America's Test Kitchen Family Cookbook (Third Edition)

# Ingredients
* 3 kg (6.6 lbs) boneless Boston butt, cut in half
* salt
* pepper
* 6 cups barbecue sauce
* cider vinegar
* tabasco

# Instructions
1. Season the pork with salt and pepper and place it in the slow cooker. Pour the barbecue sauce over the pork, cover, and cook, on either low or high, until the pork is fork-tender and falling apart, 10 to 11 hours on low or 7 to 8 hours on high.
1. Transfer the meat to a large bowl and let cool. Let the cooking liquid settle for 5 minutes, then use a wide spoon to skim the fat off the surface. Season the sauce with vinegar, tabasco, and salt and pepper to taste. When the meat is cool enough to handle, shred it using your fingers, discarding excess fat and gristle.
1. Toss the shredded meat with 1 cup of the cooking sauce, adding more as needed to keep it moist. Serve, passing the remaining sauce separately.
