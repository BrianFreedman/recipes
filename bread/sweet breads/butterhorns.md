# Ingredients
* 240 ml (1 cup) butter <sup>1</sup>
* 240 ml (1 cup) 3.5% milk <sup>2</sup>
* 2 packages (4 1/2 tsp) traditional yeast
* 2 eggs
* 80 ml (1/3 cup) sugar
* 5 ml (1 tsp) salt
* 960 ml (4 cups) flour
* 60 ml (1/4 cup) additional flour [*optional*]

### Substitutions
* <sup>1</sup> 240 ml (1 cup) brick margarine
* <sup>2</sup> 240 ml (1 cup) 2% milk

# Instructions
1. Over medium heat, add the butter and milk in a small saucepan. Once the butter has melted, take the mixture off the heat as it needs to cool before you can add it to the dough.
1. Proof the yeast.
1. Beat the eggs, sugar, salt, yeast mixture, cooled butter/milk mixture, and flour together in a large bowl.
1. With a wooden spoon, beat mixture with a circular motion until the dough is smooth and leaves the sides of the bowl. You can add a little more flour if you need to, (up to 1/4 C) but the dough will need to still be sticky.
1. Cover and let sit in the fridge for at least 2 hours. The dough will have risen to at least double in size.
1. Split dough into eighths. For each portion:
  1. Shape it into a ball and roll it out to be 1/4 inch thick in a circle.
  1. Divide the circle into 8 pie shaped wedges. Roll up starting at the widest end. Place on a greased cookie sheet.
1. Let rise in a warm place for about 1 hour. I turn the oven on to very low 170F or less and let them rise in there, and when it feels warm to the hand turn off the oven and just let the dough rise. Check it during the hour to see if you need to turn the heat back on. If you are quite slow in rolling everything out, you might not need a full hour rising. Just keep an eye on it. It should double in size. Remove cookie sheets if you are rising in the oven.
1. Preheat oven to 350F. Bake 10 mins or until golden brown.
1. Drizzle with [Icing](../../icing/icing.md) while hot.
