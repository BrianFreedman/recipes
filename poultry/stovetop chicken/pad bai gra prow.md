## Ingredients ##
* 1/3 cup chicken broth
* 1 tbsp oyster sauce
* 1 tbsp soy sauce, or as needed
* 2 tsp fish sauce
* 1 tsp white sugar
* 1 tsp brown sugar
* 2 tbsp vegetable oil
* 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts, cubed
* 1/4 cup sliced shallots
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 tbsp minced Thai chilies, Serrano, or other hot pepper
* 1 cup very thinly sliced fresh basil leaves
* 2 cups hot cooked rice

## Instructions ##
1. Whisk chicken broth, oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, white sugar, and brown sugar together in a bowl until well blended.
1. Heat large skillet over high heat. Drizzle in oil. Add chicken and stir fry until it loses its raw color, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in shallots, garlic, and sliced chilies. Continue cooking on high heat until some of the juices start to caramelize in the bottom of the pan, about 2 or 3 more minutes. Add about a tbsp of the sauce mixture to the skillet; cook and stir until sauce begins to caramelize, about 1 minute.
1. Pour in the rest of the sauce. Cook and stir until sauce has deglazed the bottom of the pan. Continue to cook until sauce glazes onto the meat, 1 or 2 more minutes. Remove from heat.
1. Stir in basil. Cook and stir until basil is wilted, about 20 seconds. Serve with rice.
