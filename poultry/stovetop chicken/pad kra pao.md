## Instructions ##
1. Pound Thai chilies into a fine paste.
1. Add garlic and spur chilies and pound into a rough paste.
Combine oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, black soy sauce, water and sugar; stir to dissolve the sugar.
1. In a wok or a large saute pan, saute the garlic-chili paste in a little vegetable oil over medium high heat until the garlic starts to turn golden.
1. Add chicken and toss until they're no longer in big clumps. Add the sauce and continue tossing until the chicken is almost done.
1. Add onions and long beans; toss until the chicken is done.
1. Remove from heat and stir in the holy basil.
1. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.
1. Heat about 1 cm of vegetable oil in a small non-stick pan or a wok over medium high heat.
1. Once the oil is hot (you want the oil very hot, especially if you like runny yolk), crack the egg directly into the pan and let it fry until the edges are browned and bubbly.
1. Serve the stir-fry over rice and _optionally_ top it with the fried egg
