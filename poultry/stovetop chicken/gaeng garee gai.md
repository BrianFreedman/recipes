## Ingredients ##
* 1x 400 ml (13.5 oz) can of coconut milk
* 30 ml (2 tbsp) yellow curry paste
* 1 boneless skinless chicken breast, cubed
* 240-480 ml (1-2 cups) water
* 2 medium potatoes
* 1/2 of a large onion
* 5 ml (1 tsp) fish sauce
* 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) sugar

## Instructions ##
1. Prepare your ingredients. Slice the onion, baby corn, and chicken into bite-sized pieces. Peel, cut, and parboil the potatoes for ~5 minutes. Set aside.
1. Open the can of coconut milk and scoop the top thicker cream part into a pan (approximately 1/2 cup). Heat this cream over medium heat until the oil just starts to separate from the milk. Then add the yellow curry paste and saute with the cream until it becomes fragrant.
1. Add the chicken, coat in the curry paste, and cook until it's done. Then add the rest of the coconut milk and water and bring to a boil. Let cook until the consistency of the curry is what you prefer. You can use less water if you want a shorter cooking time.
1. Add the potatoes and onions, and cook until just done, but still firm. Adjust seasonings with fish sauce and sugar to taste. Some curry pastes will not need any sugar or fish sauce, and others will need more than the amounts specified here.
1. Garnish with thinly sliced kaffir lime leaves and red peppers, if you like. Serve with jasmine rice.
