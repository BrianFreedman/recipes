* 2x 400 ml (13.5 oz) cans coconut milk
* 60 ml (4 tbsp) red curry paste
* 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) ground ginger
* 1.25 ml (1/4 tsp) garlic powder
* 1.25 ml (1/4 tsp) cayenne powder
* 5 ml (1 tsp) salt
* 30 ml (2 tbsp) peanut butter
* 4-5 kaffir lime leaves, sliced
* 15 ml (1 tbsp) lime juice <sup>2</sup>
* 5 ml (1 tsp) fish sauce
* 15 ml (1 tbsp) brown sugar
* 5 ml (1 tsp) flour [*optional*]

### Substitutions ###
* <sup>2</sup> 1/2 lime, juiced
* <sup>2</sup> 15 ml (1 tbsp) lemon juice

## Instructions ##
1. Prepare your ingredients. Slice the peppers, onion, and chicken into bite-sized pieces. Set aside.
1. Open the can of coconut milk and scoop the top thicker cream part into a pan (approximately 1/2 of each can). Heat this cream over medium heat until the oil just starts to separate from the milk. Then add the red curry paste, ginger, garlic, cayenne powder, salt, peanut butter, lime leaves, and lime juice. Cook with the cream until it becomes fragrant.
1. Add the chicken coat in the curry paste, and cook until it's done. Then add the rest of the coconut milk and water and bring to a boil. Let cook until the consistency of the curry is what you prefer. You can use less water if you want a shorter cooking time.
1. Add the peppers and onions, and cook until just done, but still firm. Adjust seasonings with fish sauce and sugar to taste. Some curry pastes will not need any sugar or fish sauce, and others will need more than the amounts specified here.
