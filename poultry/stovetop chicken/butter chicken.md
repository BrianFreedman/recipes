## Ingredients ##
* 90 ml (6 tbsp) butter, divided
* 2 boneless skinless chicken breast, cubed
* 1 yellow onion, diced
* 3 garlic cloves, minced <sup>1</sup>
* 15 ml (1 tbsp) garam masala
* 15 ml (1 tbsp) fresh grated ginger <sup>2</sup>
* 5 ml (1 tsp) chili powder
* 5 ml (1 tsp) ground cumin
* 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) cayenne pepper
* 1.25 ml (1/4 tsp) ground fenugreek seeds
* 1x 680 ml (23 oz) can of tomato sauce
* 480 ml (2 cups) cream
* 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) dried fenugreek leaves

### Substitutions ###
* <sup>1</sup> 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) garlic powder
* <sup>2</sup> 1.25 ml (1/4 tsp) ground ginger

## Instructions ##
1. Using 2 Tbsp of butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat, brown the pieces of the chicken so each side is browned. They do not need to be fully cooked all the way through. Work in batches, and set aside when you’re done.
1. Melt another 2 Tbsp of butter in the pan over medium heat. Add the onion, and cook until beginning to soften — about three minutes. Add the garlic, garam masala, ginger, chili powder, cumin, cayenne, and ground fenugreek seeds. Stir to combine, and cook for about 45 seconds before adding the tomato sauce.
1. Bring the mixture to a simmer and let cook for five minutes before adding the cream and fenugreek. Bring the mixture back to a simmer, add the browned chicken and the dried fenugreek leaves, and let simmer for 10-15 minutes. Keep the heat low here — not a rolling boil.
1. Stir in the remaining 2 Tbsp of butter, and season with salt and pepper, to taste.
1. Serve garnished with lime and cilantro, alongside rice and naan.
