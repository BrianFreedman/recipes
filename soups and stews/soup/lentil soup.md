## Ingredients ##
* 1x 900 ml (3.75 cups) chicken stock
* 480 ml (2 cups) water
* (1.5 cups) lentils
* (3 tbsp) vegetable oil
* 1 onion, chopped
* 1 large carrot, chopped
* 2 stalks celery, chopped
* 4 cloves garlic, minced <sup>1</sup>
* 5 ml (1 tsp) ground cumin
* 2.5 ml (0.5 tsp) dried oregano
* 1 bay leaf
* 15 ml (1 tbsp) vinegar
* 5 ml (1 tsp) salt
* black pepper

### Substitutions ###
* <sup>1</sup> 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) garlic powder


## Instructions ##
1. Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a large soup pot or Dutch oven. Add the chopped onion, carrot, and celery with a big pinch of sea salt and cook until tender, about 5-6 minutes.
1. Lower the heat down to medium-low (to prevent the garlic from burning) and add the garlic, cumin, oregano, another pinch of salt, and a few spins of freshly ground black pepper. Stir and let cook another 2-3 minutes until the mixture is very fragrant.
1. Add the bay leaf, salt, a few more spins of black pepper, stock, water, and lentils to the pot and bring to a full boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Let the pot simmer for about 40-50 minutes or until the lentils are soft. Once the lentils are soft, turn off the heat and stir in the vinegar. Discard the bay leaf before pureeing and serving.
1. Blend the whole thing up in a high-speed blender (in batches) to make a silky smooth lentil soup.
