## Ingredients ##
* 45 ml (3 tbsp) unsalted butter
* 3-4 large leeks, white and light green parts only
* 3 cloves garlic <sup>1</sup>
* 0.9 kg (2 lbs) yukon gold potatoes, chopped
* 1.8 L (7 cups) chicken broth
* 2 bay leaves
* 3 sprigs thyme <sup>2</sup>
* 5 ml (1 tsp) salt
* 1.25 ml (1/4 tsp) ground black pepper
* 240 ml (1 cup) heavy cream

### Substitutions ###
* <sup>1</sup> 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) garlic powder
* <sup>2</sup> 1.25 ml (1/4 tsp) dried thyme

## Instructions ##
1. Melt the butter over medium heat in a large soup pot. Add the leeks and garlic and cook, stirring regularly, until soft and wilted, about 10 minutes. Adjust the heat as necessary so as not to brown.
1. Add the potatoes, stock, bay leaves, thyme, salt and pepper to pot and bring to a boil. Cover and turn the heat down to low. Simmer for 15 minutes, or until the potatoes are very soft.
1. Fish out the thyme sprig and bay leaves, then purée the soup with a hand-held immersion blender until smooth. (Alternatively, use a standard blender to purée the soup in batches; see note.) Add the heavy cream and bring to a simmer. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. If soup is too thin, simmer until thickened. If it's too thick, add water or stock to thin it out.
