# Banana Bread #

Source: The America's Test Kitchen Family Cookbook (Third Edition)

## Ingredients ##
* 480 ml (2 cups) flour
* 180 ml (3/4 cup) sugar
* 3.75 ml (3/4 tsp) baking soda
* 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) salt
* 3 very ripe bananas, mashed
* 90 ml (6 tbsp [3/4 stick]) unsalted butter, melted and cooled
* 2 large eggs, lightly beaten
* 60 ml (1/4 cup) plain yogurt
* 5 ml (1 tsp) vanilla extract

## Instructions ##
1. Adjust an oven rack to the lower-middle position and heat the oven to 177 Celsius (350 Fahrenheit). Generously coat a 21.5 cm by 11.5 cm (8 1/2 by 4 1/2 inch) loaf pan with vegetable oil spray.
1. Whisk the flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Whisk the mashed bananas, melted butter, eggs, yogurt, and vanilla together in a separate bowl. Gently fold the banana mixture into the flour mixture with a rubber spatula until just combined. Do not overmix; the batter will look thick and chunky.
1. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake until golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with just a few crumbs attached, about 55 minutes.
1. Let the loaf cool in the pan for 10 minutes before unmolding onto a wire rack to cool for 1 hour.
