# Banana Bread

Source: The America's Test Kitchen Family Cookbook (Third Edition)

## Ingredients
* 2 cups flour
* 3/4 cup sugar
* 3/4 tsp baking soda
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 3 very ripe bananas, mashed
* 6 tbsp (3/4 stick) unsalted butter, melted and cooled
* 2 large eeggs, lightly beaten
* 1/4 cup plain yogurt
* 1 tsp vanilla extract

## Instructions
1. Adjust an oven rack to the lower-middle position and heat the oven to 350 degrees. Generously coat an 8 1/2 by 4 1/2 inch loaf pan with vegetable oil spray.
2. Whisk the flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Whisk the mashed bananas, melted butter, eggs, yogurt, and vanilla together in a separate bowl. Gently fold the banana mixture into the flour mixture with a rubber spatula until just combined. Do not overmix; the batter will look thick and chunky.
3. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake until golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with just a few crumbs attached, about 55 minutes.
4. Let the loaf cool in the pan for 10 minutes before unmolding onto a wire rack to cool for 1 hour.
