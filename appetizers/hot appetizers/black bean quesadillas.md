## Ingredients ##
* 1x 15 oz can black beans, rinsed
* 240 ml (1 cup) shredded cheese
* 120 ml (1/2 cup) salsa, divided
* 6 tortillas
* 3 teaspoons canola oil, divided
* 1 ripe avocado, diced

## Instructions ##
1. Combine beans, cheese and 1/4 cup salsa in a medium bowl. Place tortillas on a work surface. Spread filling on half of each tortilla. Fold tortillas in half, pressing gently to flatten.
1. Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add 2 quesadillas and cook, turning once, until golden on both sides, 2 to 4 minutes total. Transfer to a cutting board and tent with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining oil and quesadillas. Serve the quesadillas with avocado and the remaining salsa.
