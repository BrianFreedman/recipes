## Ingredients ##
* 1x 400 ml (13.5 oz) can refried beans
* 60 ml (1/4 cup) fresh cilantro, minced
* 30 ml (2 tbsp) salsa
* 15 ml (1 tbsp) Tabasco
* 5 ml (1 tsp) cumin
* 8 tortillas
* 480 ml (2 cup) shredded cheese

## Instructions ##
1. Adjust the oven racks to the upper and lower middle positions and heat the oven to 475 degrees. Combine the refried beans, cilantro, salsa, Tabasco, and cumin in a medium bowl. Spread 60 ml (1/4) cup of the filling over half of each tortilla, leaving a 1.25 cm (1/2 inch) border. Sprinkle 60 ml (1/4) cup of cheese over the filling. Spray the plain half of the tortilla with vegetable oil spray and fold over the filling. Press the edges of the tortilla gently together to seal.
1. Arrange on two baking sheets lined with parchment paper. Spray lightly with vegetable oil spray and bake until the quesadillas are golden, 12 to 15 minutes.
1. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool for 5 minutes before cutting into pieces.
