* salt and pepper
* 30 ml (2 tbsp) vegetable oil
* 1 onion, diced
* 1 red bell pepper, diced
* 4 garlic cloves, minced <sup>1</sup>
* 5 ml (1 tsp) cumin
* 60 ml (1/4 cup) fresh cilantro, minced

## Instructions ##
1. Adjust the oven racks to the upper and lower middle positions and heat the oven to 475 degrees. Pat the chicken thoroughly dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper to taste. Heat 15 ml (1 tbsp) of the vegetable oil in a 30 cm (12 inch) nonstick skillet over medium heat  until shimmering. Carefully lay the chicken in the pan and cook until lightly golden brown on both sides and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer the chicken to a plate and refrigerate until cool enough to handle. Shred or slice the chilled chicken into bite-sized pieces and transfer to a large bowl.
1. While the chicken cools, add the remaining 15 ml (1 tbsp) oil to the skillet and return to medium heat until shimmering. Add the onion, bell pepper, and 1.25 ml (1/4 tsp) salt. Cook until the vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cumin and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the cooked vegetables to the bowl with the shredded chicken. Add the cilantro and Tabasco and toss to combine.
1. Spread 60 ml (1/4) cup of the filling over half of each tortilla, leaving a 1.25 cm (1/2 inch) border. Sprinkle 60 ml (1/4) cup of cheese over the filling. Spray the plain half of the tortilla with vegetable oil spray and fold over the filling. Press the edges of the tortilla gently together to seal.
1. Arrange on two baking sheets lined with parchment paper. Spray lightly with vegetable oil spray and bake until the quesadillas are golden, 10 to 15 minutes.
1. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool for 5 minutes before cutting into pieces.
