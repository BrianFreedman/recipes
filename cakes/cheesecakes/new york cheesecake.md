## Ingredients ##

### Crust ###
* 300 ml (1 1/4 cup) graham cracker crumbs
* 75 ml (5 tbsp) unsalted butter, melted
* 15 ml (1 tbsp) sugar

### Filling ###
* 1.1 kg (2.5 lbs) cream cheese, cut into 1-inch chunks and softened
* 360 ml (1 1/2 cup) sugar
* 0.65 ml (1/8 tsp) salt
* 80 ml (1/3 cup) sour cream
* 10 ml (2 tsp) lemon juice
* 10 ml (2 tsp) vanilla extract
* 2 large egg yolks, at room temperature
* 6 large eggs, at room temperature
* 15 ml (1 tbsp) unsalted butter, melted

## Instructions ##
1. For the crust: Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 325 degrees. Mix the graham crumbs, melted butter, and sugar together, then pour into a 9-inch springform pan. Press the crumbs firmly into an even layer using the bottom of a measuring cup. Bake the crust until fragrant and beginning to brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Let cool on a wire rack, about 30 minutes.
1. For the filling: Meanwhile, increase the oven temperature to 500 degrees. Beat the cream cheese in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-low speed until softened, 1 to 3 minutes. Scrape down the bowl and beaters thoroughly.
1. Beat in half of the sugar and the salt until incorporated, 1 to 3 minutes. Beat in the remaining sugar until incorporated, 1 to 3 minutes. Beat in the sour cream, lemon juice, and vanilla extract until incorporated, 1 to 3 minutes. Beat in the egg yolks until incorporated, 1 to 3 minutes. Beat in the eggs, two at a time, until incorporated, scraping down the bowl and beaters as needed, 1 to 3 minutes.
1. Being careful not to disturb the baked crust, brush the sides of the springform pan with the melted butter. Set the pan on a rimmed baking sheet. Pour the filling over the crust and bake for 10 minutes.
1. Without opening the oven door, reduce the oven temperature to 200 degrees and continue to bake until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the cheesecake reads about 150 degrees, about 1 hour and 30 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through baking.
1. Transfer the cake to a wire rack and run a paring knife around the edge of the cake. Let cool until barely warm, 2.5 to 3 hours, running a paring knife around the edge of the cake every hour or so. Wrap the pan tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate until cold, at least 3 hours.
1. To unmold the cheesecake, wrap a wet hot kitchen towel around the springform pan and let sit for 1 minute. Remove the sides of the pan. Let the cheesecake stand at room temperature about 30 minutes before serving.
