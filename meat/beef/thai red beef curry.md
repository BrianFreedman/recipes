* 1 tbsp vegetable oil
* 1 1/2 tbsp red curry paste
* 1x 14 oz can coconut milk

# Instructions
1. Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add the curry paste and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Whisk in the coconut milk, fish sauce, and brown sugar and simmer until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.
